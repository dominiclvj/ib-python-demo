# Choose the Data Type

## Learning

Every value in Python carries a data type that dictates how the interpreter stores it and what operations make sense. Choosing the right type is like choosing the right tool: a hammer for nails, a screwdriver for screws. Numbers without decimals belong to `int`, decimal numbers to `float`, text to `str`, and truth values to `bool`.

In the accompanying script you will find four empty variables: `year`, `pi`, `greeting`, and `is_sunny`. Your task is to assign each one a literal of the correct primitive type and then run the program so they print neatly in order.

```python
year = 2025        # int
pi = 3.142         # float
greeting = "Hello" # str
is_sunny = True    # bool
```

Why does the choice matter? Selecting an `int` over a `str` for a year lets you perform arithmetic—add, subtract, compare—without cumbersome conversions. Correct types also influence memory usage and guard against subtle bugs.

After assigning, add a brief comment beside each line justifying your selection. This habit forces you to think deliberately rather than guess. The checkpoint inspects both the type of each variable and the presence of appropriate comments, so accuracy and explanation must align.

Once the console shows all four values you have demonstrated mastery of basic primitives. Soon you will combine them in complex structures, but every skyscraper needs a firm foundation. Laying that foundation now ensures future algorithms stand tall without wobbling. Remember: computers treat values literally—give them the wrong type and they will follow your mistaken instructions perfectly.
