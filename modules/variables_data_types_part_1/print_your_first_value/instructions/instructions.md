# Print Your First Value

## Learning

When you write code the computer cannot guess who you are or what you like—it only knows what you tell it. In this short exercise you will teach Python two personal facts: your name and a number you enjoy. These will live in memory as variables, little labelled boxes ready for use whenever your program needs them.

A variable is created with an identifier on the left of an equals sign and a value on the right. Python chooses the type automatically, but it is good practice to pick clear identifiers so others immediately see a variable’s purpose.

```python
student_name = "Ananda"
favourite_number = 42
print(student_name)
print(favourite_number)
```

The `print()` function sends data to the console so you can read it. Notice that strings live in quotation marks while numbers do not. If you accidentally wrap the number in quotes it will behave like text and arithmetic will fail later.

In today’s lesson we focus on two things: remembering data and showing it. Your code will first assign your own name to `student_name` and display it. Next you will store any whole number in `favourite_number` and print that too. Completing these tasks proves you can write basic assignment statements, choose sensible identifiers, and verify output.

Once you see both pieces of information in the right‑hand pane you will have cleared the first checkpoint and can move forward with confidence. Variables may feel trivial, yet every complex program—from social apps to space probes—still begins with a simple assignment like this.
