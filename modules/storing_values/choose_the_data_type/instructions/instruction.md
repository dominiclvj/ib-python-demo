# Choose the Data Type

## Learning
Integers count whole things, floats measure fractions, strings record text and booleans track simple truth. These four primitives are Python’s alphabet for representing information. Selecting the right type is not decoration—it shapes how memory is stored and which operations are legal.

The starter file declares four variables but assigns `None` to each placeholder. Your mission is to replace those placeholders with suitable literals: one `int`, one `float`, one `str` and one `bool`. Pick any values you like so long as each demonstrates its category clearly. For example, `42`, `3.14`, `"banana"` and `True` would satisfy the requirement.

After assignment the script prints the four variables in a single `print()` call. When executed, the console should list all values separated by spaces. Behind the scenes our checks will verify that every variable belongs to its promised type using `isinstance()`. Choosing wisely ensures those checks pass.

Knowing when to deploy each primitive builds confidence for later tasks involving collections, arithmetic and logic. It also encourages you to anticipate how the computer will treat your data, a habit that prevents subtle bugs as your programs scale.
