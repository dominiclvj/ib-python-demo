# Age Calculator 2050

## Learning
Programs often start with unknowns supplied by the user, transform those inputs mathematically, and report friendly results. In this challenge you will combine input handling, type conversion and arithmetic to predict a person’s age on 1 January 2050.

Begin by prompting the user for their birth year. Remember that the `input()` function returns a string, so convert the response to an integer with `int()`. Store the number in a variable called `birth_year`. Next, compute the age in 2050 by subtracting that year from the constant `2050`, saving the result in `age_2050`.

To demonstrate flexible thinking, declare at least one additional `float` variable (perhaps the same age expressed with decimal precision) and one `bool` that states whether the age exceeds 30. Display a readable sentence that includes the computed age. An f‑string such as `f"In 2050 you will be {age_2050}."` keeps the output tidy.

Successful completion shows you can gather data, convert between types and perform arithmetic—all indispensable skills for larger projects like financial forecasters or fitness trackers. It also reinforces the habit of choosing meaningful variable names and mixing multiple primitives in a coherent program.
