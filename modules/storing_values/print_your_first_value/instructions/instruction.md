# Print Your First Value

## Learning
Your screen is the story‑teller for every Python adventure. The `print()` function sends words and numbers racing from memory to the console so that people—not silicon—can read them. In this first task you will practise printing two different kinds of data: a line of text and a number.

Think of `print()` as a loudspeaker. Anything placed between its parentheses is announced, left‑to‑right, exactly as you instruct. If you list several items, Python separates them with a single space, just like a friendly pause in conversation. For example, `print("Alice", 42)` shows both a string and an integer on one line.

Strings are surrounded by single or double quotes; integers are whole numbers without punctuation. Mixing them in a single call gives useful, readable output while showing off Python’s automatic spacing. Behind the scenes, each object keeps its own type, proving that one function can handle many kinds of data.

Your challenge is to greet the world with a personal twist. Edit the accompanying script so it prints **your name** and **your favourite number** in one call. Avoid hard‑coding spaces—let the comma inside `print()` do the work. When you run the script, the console should display two items separated by exactly one space. Finishing this proves you can control basic output and recognise the difference between textual and numeric data—skills that underpin every larger program you will write.
