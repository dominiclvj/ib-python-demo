## Learning
Every piece of data belongs to a type that advertises how the computer should store and manipulate it. Pick wisely and Python will protect precision, save memory and unlock handy methods.  

Your template declares three empty variables: `temp_int`, `temp_float`, and `temp_bool`. Read the hypothetical sensor values in the comments and assign each variable the most suitable literal. For example a whole‑number temperature suits an `int`, whereas 36.6° requires a `float`.  

After assigning, add a short inline comment explaining *why* you chose that type. Use the pattern:  

```python
temp_float = 18.5  # decimal needed for accuracy
```  

Run the script; correct choices and comments will pass the checks. You are now practising defensive thinking—selecting the optimal container before pouring in the data.
