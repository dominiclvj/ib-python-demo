Ever shouted your own name into a canyon just to hear it echo back?  A computer can do something similar—only perfectly every time. In this mini‑task you will store your name in memory and ask Python to repeat it on demand.  

Variables are simply labels we stick on boxes of data so we can find them later.  In Python a new variable appears the moment you write an identifier, an equals sign and a value.  For text that value must be wrapped in quotes to create a `str`.  The pairing lives in RAM until the program ends or you overwrite it.  

```python
your_name = "Ada"
print(your_name)
```

The first line assigns; the second line passes the stored value to the `print()` function, which streams text to the console.  You can substitute any legal identifier on the left and any string literal on the right, so long as they are joined by `=`.  

Today’s canyon‑call has two steps.  First, create a variable called `your_name` and place a non‑empty string inside.  Second, use `print()` to display that value.  When the script runs you should see your own name appear exactly once in the output panel.  

By finishing you will prove you can store a value and retrieve it—skills every larger program depends on.
