# Print Your First Value
## Learning
You have just been hired to create personalised wristbands for a school trip. Each band must show the pupil’s name and their assigned coach number so teachers can match students to buses. If your script prints only one detail, the boarding queue descends into chaos.

A variable is simply a labelled box in memory. When you write `name = "Mina"` you reserve storage tagged *name* and drop “Mina” inside. The `print()` function will peek inside a box and shows its contents in the Output window. The order you place statements decides which line appears first. 

```python
name = "Mina"
coach_number = 42
print(name)
print(coach_number)
```

The code snippet above will first print the student's name, then print their coach number. If you reverse the order of the print statements, you'll also reverse the order in which you see them in the Output.

Your task is to try this out for yourself in the code editor, either with two `print()` calls or an f‑string. Pick sensible names for the variables that are descruptive. Beyond this micro‑task lies the habit of combining separate pieces of data so humans can act quickly; the same steps power boarding passes, shipping labels, and countless other everyday tools.

When both values appear on screen you will know the wristbands are legible and the buses can roll without confusion.
